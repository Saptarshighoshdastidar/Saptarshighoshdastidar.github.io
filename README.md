## Projects
### Netflix Recommendation System: [To create an model to recommend similar movies to users] 
[Publication](https://github.com/Saptarshighoshdastidar/netflix-recommendation)

The main objective of this project is to create a recommendation engine to recommend similar movies to users.Implemented Python,NLP,TensorFlow,PyTorch,Keras for Recommending similar movies to users,
We will be creating one such Recommendation Engine from the ground-up, where every single user, based on their area of interest and ratings, would be recommended a list of movies that are best suited for them.


### Walmart Sales Forecasting: [Used for future demand and to make info supply chain decisions]
[Publication](https://github.com/Saptarshighoshdastidar/Capstone-Walmart)

This repository contains the code and documentation for a time series forecasting model aimed at predicting Walmart's weekly sales. The model is designed to help Walmart manage its inventory by forecasting future demand, allowing the company to make informed supply chain decisions.Developed an API-based forecasting component for easy integration with Walmart’s internal supply chain
management system, enabling seamless real-time data updates and predictions.

### Customer Churn Prediction:[Aims to predict customer churn for a telecom company by ML models]
[Publication](https://github.com/Saptarshighoshdastidar/Capstone-Walmart)

Developed a customer churn prediction model using Random Forest and XGBoost, achieving an AUC-ROC score of 0.89, significantly improving prediction accuracy compared to baseline models.bImplemented a real-time churn prediction feature, processing 10 million customer interaction records weekly, leveraging PySpark for distributed data processing on a Hadoop cluster.
